# AWS Container Experiments

This repo contains code for my experiments with the AWS container ecosystem. The idea is to build a very simple distributed application that allows me to play around and develop a solid grasp of relevant AWS services and tools, including but not limited to as ECS, EKS, CodePipeline, eksctl and copilot.
